__Action Routing__

Route to your controller action simply by specifying the route string. E.g. Action route "conroller/action" where "controller" is a controller class file located in the /mvc/controllers folder and "action" is a class function of the controller.

__JSON Data Passing to Actions__

Pass JSON data object to controller action function by simply by passing the route string and data object to the TiMVC App class. The core TiMVC App class handles all routing and data passing.
